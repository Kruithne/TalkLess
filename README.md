== TalkLess ==

This project is open-source and maintained on GitHub here: https://github.com/Kruithne/TalkLess

This is a simple World of Warcraft add-on that will mute/hide the sound of Talking Heads introduced in Legion once you have already heard them once. The next the NPC would normally say will come up in your chat log instead!
